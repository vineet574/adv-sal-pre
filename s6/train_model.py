# Step 5: Create the RandomForest model (our smart predictor)
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)  # 100 trees will "vote" to predict salary

# Step 6: Train the model (we show it examples from the training data)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 7: Save the trained model to a file (so we donâ€™t have to teach it again)
joblib.dump(model, 'salary_prediction_model.pkl')  # This file contains the learned patterns to predict salaries
